aleoncean-openhab-binding
=========================

This projected started as a openHAB 1 binding.

The upstream development of openHAB 1 is not completely stopped, but the main focus is moved to the openHAB 2 project now.

We are using this binding with the openHAB 2 compatibility layer for openHAB 1 bindings (compat1x), only.

The binding code uses OSGi service component annotations.
The annotations are part of the OSGiâ„¢ Service Platform Compendium Specification Release 4 Version 4.3 and above.

openHAB 1 is currently using the version 4.2

So this binding will not work out of the box using the openHAB 1 runtime anymore.
